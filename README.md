### INTRODUCTION ###

Emergency is a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action. Emergency can be due to fire, human error(e.g. road accidents), electricity or others. In times of distress, help is what everyone asks but none gives. In such situations, a website or an app which provides such help proves to be a blessing.

### IDEA ###

Through our project, we would bring forward volunteer help in case of an emergency situation. The project will enable people to contact help for all kinds of situations through a single platform. The project will give necessary details about the nearest medical facilities and nearest police stations. It will also provide assistant videos and an emergency calling feature. Not only this, but it will also have a bar for emergency contacts through which warning messages and location can be shared. We understand that in times of such unexpected and undesirable situations, things get so diffcult to locate so, we are planning to build a project which will give all sorts if related information at a single place.
