## EFFICIENT SOS


### INTRODUCTION 

Emergency can be described as a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action. Emergency can be of various types like fire, human error(e.g. road accidents), electric shocks and many more. In times of distress, help is something that one needs but many a times is unable to recieve due to improper communication channel or mostly due to communication delay. In such situations, a website or an app which provides such help proves to be a blessing.

### THE PROBLEM

In a country like ours due to enourmous population and lack of facilities the rate of death increases majorly due to the lack of communication and intelect during the time of an Emergency, Waiting for the first responders to arrive is not always an option. When the situation gets dire, effective communication and support becomes essential to tackel the emergency.

### OUR PROJECT

Our project ***EFFICIENT SOS***, aims to bring forward volunteer help in case of any emergency situation. The project will enable people to contact help for any kind of emergency situations quickely and efficiently through a single platform. The platform not only provide services during the time of emergency, but will also provide with necessary details about the nearest aid facilities. It will also provide **assistant videos**, which would help the user to control the situation until professional help arrives, and an **emergency calling feature**, making sure that the family always stay in the loop. Through the project we also aim to provide video calling facilities directly to professionals, which would help them analyse the situation and guide the user for immediate relief.  

### KEY HIGHLIGHTS 

* Single Platform for all SOLUTIONS

### AIM

* Our Aim through this project is to provide a platform that every person, just having a cellphone or any device with GPS, can use to call for help during emergency situations just by clicking on the right button. 
* We also aim to control the rise in the death rates by eleminating the factor of miscomunication and lack of knowledge of how to handel the situation.
